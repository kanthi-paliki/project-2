#Description

This project demonstrates Simple Linear Regression using the Least Square Method. It calculates the best-fit line for a set of data points by minimizing the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual values.

#Features

--> Calculates slope an dintercept using least squares formula

--> Acccepts input values from user.

-->Predicts the output using the regression line.
